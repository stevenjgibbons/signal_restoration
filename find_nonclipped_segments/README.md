This directory contains a python script one_file_plot.py that will display a file and write out files containing segments of simple time-series numbers where the samples are assumed not to be clipped.
As the script stands at the moment you need to make directories 'plots' and 'outfiles' but it is the intention that you can rewrite the script as you wish.
